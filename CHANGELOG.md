This is the very first open-source VP-Digi release.
## New features

**When updating from version <1.2.0 please erase configuration or set new settings carefully.**
* Selectable signal input type: normal (filtered) audio or flat (unfiltered) audio: ```flat [on/off]``` - switches modem settings - before v. 1.2.0 was hardcoded for normal audio
* Erase all settings command: ```eraseall```
## Bug fixes
